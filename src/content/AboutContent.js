    'paragraph_one': 'Hello! My name is Oliver, and I\'m a friendly and enthusiastic software developer. I started programming during my first year of university; I quickly became obsessed with computers, and focused my studies on software & robotics. My interest in Front-End development originates from my love for Art, and has developed into a passion for how intuitive UI makes complicated apps easy to use.',
    'paragraph_two': 'I joined Konrad Group because I saw an opportunity to work with world class clients, and join a team of truly awesome people. Four years later, I love the team and I\'m still learning every sprint.',
    'paragraph_three': 'Outside of programming, I spend most of my time walking my dog, Indigo! She needs a LOT of exercise. I also like to listen to live music, and when possible, I travel internationally to learn more about other people and cultures.',
