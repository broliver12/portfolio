## Portfolio

A lightweight React site that works as a modular & scalable personal portfolio.

## Design 

Design inspired (heavily) by @BrittanyChiang's [Portfolio V4](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4).

All components & animations were created from scratch using React, CSS, Figma.

## TODO

1. Make this repository a template that's extremely intuitive to download and setup for a first time react user.

2. Add fun themes, additional decoration & explore the limits of CSS.
